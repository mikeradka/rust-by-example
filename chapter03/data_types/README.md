# Data Types
The [Chapter 3.2 Exercise](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html) from [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Additional Notes
### Scalar Data Types
A _scalar_ data type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
 1. [Integers](#integer-types)
 1. [Floating-point numbers](#floating-point-types)
 1. [Booleans](#the-boolean-type)
 1. [Characters](#the-character-type)
#### Integer Types
- A number *without* a fractional component. - For example, the `u32` is an *unsigned 32-bit integer* (takes up 32 bits of space)
- Any of the below types can be used in Rust to declare the type of integer value:

| Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
|---------|--------|----------|
| 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
| arch    | isize  | usize    |

- **Unsigned** integer types start with a `u`, and can be *positive or negative*.
-  **Signed** integer types start with an `i`, and can *only be positive*. Signed numbers are stored using [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation. Basically, an `i8` can store numbers from **-128 to 127** and a `u8` can store numbers from **0 to 255**.
- The `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on.

| Number Literals  | Example     |
|------------------|-------------|
| Decimal          | 98_222      |
| Hex              | 0xff        |
| Octal            | 0o77        |
| Binary           | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (`u8` only) | b'A'        |

- In Rust, integer types default to `i32`. The primary situation in which you'd use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection.

#### Floating-Point Types
* Rust has two primitive types for *floating-point numbers*, which are numbers with decimal points. 
* Rust's floating types are `f32` and `f64`.
* The default type is `f64`.
* All floating-point types are signed
* Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```
* Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.

#### Numeric Operations
* Rust supports basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplecation, division, and remainder.

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

* A list of all operators that Rust provides is [listed here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-02-operators.html).

#### The Boolean Type
- Just like other programming languages, a boolean in Rust has two possible values: `true` and `false`.
- Booleans are one byte in size.
- Booleans in Rust are specified using `bool`.
```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```
- Boolean values are mainly used through conditionals, such as an `if` expression.

#### The Character Type
- Rust's `char` type is the language's most primitive alphabetic type.

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```
- `char` literals are specified with single quotes, whereas string literals are specified with double quotes.
- Rust's `char` type is four bytes in size.
- It represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII.

### Compound Data Types
_Compound data types_ can group _multiple values_ into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types:
1. [Tuples](#the-tuple-type)
2. [Arrays](#the-array-type)

#### The Tuple Type
- A _tuple_ is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into a compund data type.
- Tuples have a fixed length. Once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
- A tuple is created by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parenthesis. Each position in the tuple has a type, which do not have to be the same.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```
- The variable `my_tup` _binds_ to the entire tuple, because it is considered a _single compound element_.
- To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use _pattern matching_ to _destructure_ a tuple value:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = my_tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```
- The above example first creates a tuple, `my_tup`, with three values.
- Next, the tuple `my_tup` is "destructured" - broken into three parts: `x`, `y`, and `z`.

- A tuple element can also be accessed directly by using a period (`.`), followed by the index of the value
 you want to access. For example:
 ```rust
 fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
 ```
 - This program creates the tuple x and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is `0`.

 - The tuple without any values has a special name, _unit_. This value and its corresponding type are both written `()` and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they donâ€™t return any other value.

 #### The Array Type
 - Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an _array_. Unlike a _tuple_, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, **arrays in Rust have a fixed length**.
 - We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:
 ```rust
 fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 }
 ```
 - _Arrays_ are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap (more in Chapter 4) or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements.
 - An _array_ is **not** as flexible as a _vector_ type.
 - A _vector_ is a similar _collection_ type provided by the standard library that **is allowed to grow or shrink in size. If youâ€™re unsure whether to use an _array_ or a _vector_, chances are you should use a _vector_**.
 - _Arrays_ are more useful **when you know the number of elements will not need to change**. For example, an array of months:

```rust
let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
              "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
``` 

- You write an arrayâ€™s type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:
```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
